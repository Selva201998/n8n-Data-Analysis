🚀 Automating Data Analysis with AI & n8n

I recently built a workflow integrating n8n, OpenAI, and Google Sheets to streamline CSV-based data analysis. This project enables an AI assistant to process structured data dynamically, providing accurate responses while ensuring factual integrity.

🔧 How It Works:
1️⃣ A chat trigger initiates user queries.
2️⃣ The AI agent analyzes the Google Sheets dataset to extract relevant insights.
3️⃣ An OpenAI-powered model interprets the data while adhering to strict accuracy rules.
4️⃣ A memory buffer maintains conversational context for seamless interactions.

🎯 Key Features:
✅ AI-driven, real-time responses to data queries.
✅ Direct integration with Google Sheets for structured data analysis.
✅ Scalable and adaptable for various use cases.

This solution is perfect for automating insights from structured data, reducing manual effort, and improving efficiency.
